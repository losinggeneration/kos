28.07.2002:
-----------

- sndoggvorbis has been updated to the final 1.0 release of the Xiphophorus
  libogg and libvorbis libraries

07.01.2002:
-----------

- sndoggvorbis now uses the same sndstream.c as libmp3 and therefore uses DMA
  to transfer Audio Data to AICA memory.

01.01.2002:
-----------

- Updated Ogg/Vorbis decoder to "Xiphophorus libVorbis I 20011231" or to put
  it more plain "Ogg/Vorbis 1.0 RC3"
- Fixed a small bug in Ghettoplay-Vorbis when using the shoulder-buttons to
  navigate

11.11.2001:
-----------

- Again some resorting of the sources. Sadly due to my involvement in Japanese
  language studies I didn't find time to take a more detailed look into
  seeking.
    
21.10.2001:
-----------

- Minor cleanups after a whole week of lying in bed with a heavy form of the
  flu.

11.10.2001:
-----------

- Put basic decoding functionality into an own object rather than including a
  complete C sourcefile into sndoggvorbis.c
- Fixed problems in the thread related code. Now the library shuts down
  correctly after sndoggvorbis_shutdown()
- Fixed problem with sndoggvorbis_isplaying() which would return FALSE if
  library is in STATUS_STARTING state.

08.10.2001:
-----------

- Added processing of comment information in Vorbis Files and added
  get-functions to library interface
- Added routine for calculation of approximated current bitrate

07.10.2001:
-----------

- Added code to get the nominal bitrate of a file out of the
  Vorbis headers
- First release with basic player functionality within a thread

05.10.2001:
-----------

- Put the file-decoder routines in a thread skeleton similar to
  that of KOS' libmp3 [Thanks to DCGrendel for sending a stripped
  down sndserver.c]

pre 05.10.2001:
---------------

- Basic File-decoder written for output via serial-link to DC 
- Ported libogg and libvorbis by Xiph.org to KallistiOS
