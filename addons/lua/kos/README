Lua for KOS
-----------

This is just a quick port of the basic Lua libs to KOS. Some things are not
supported well, and some are out and out hacked for the moment (for example,
fputs and io_write in src/lib/liolib.c and lbaselib.c). For the most part,
however, it is actually a real port.

See examples/dreamcast/lua for some sample client code.
