This is Xiph.Org's "Tremor" library, ported to KOS. It is meant to be
pretty much a drop-in replacement for liboggvorbisplay, but it is smaller,
a bit more efficient, and uses no floating point. It is probably also
a bit less buggy on KOS (and SH-4 GCC ;) since it's less complex.

To use it, you should basically just link -ltremor instead of
-loggvorbisplay. Everything else should basically work as-is.
