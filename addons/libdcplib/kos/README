Dreamcast PLIB Derivative

This is a partial port of PLIB (see plib.sourceforge.net) to the Dreamcast.
It is released under the LGPL, with one special exception (see LICENSE).


Installation
------------
Now that this comes with KOS, just use the standard make.
Note that you'll need a C++ compiler for the Dreamcast.

Usage
-----
Three components of PLIB were ported to the Dreamcast.  I'll just be describing
differences from standard PLIB - for the standard PLIB documentation see
plib.sourceforge.net.

UL - Utility Library
#include <dcplib/ul.h>
The only part of the Utility library ported was the error handling functions.
They are unchanged from those in standard PLIB.

SG - Simple Geometry Library
#include <dcplib/sg.h>
This is all ported and is unchanged from standard PLIB.

FNT - Font Library
#include <dcplib/fnt.h>
This is all ported, and has changed somewhat.  It now uses the Dreamcast's PVR
instead of OpenGL.  Here's a list of changes:
- When loading a file, there is no optional parameters to set the OpenGL
maginification and minification filters.
- You may only call begin () when you could submit a transparent polygon header
to the TA.  Likewise with putch () and puts () outside a begin/end pair.
- fntRenderer has new methods: 
    setColor (float red, float green, float blue, float alpha = 1.0f)
    getColor (float *red, float *green, float *blue, float *alpha = NULL)
      Should be fairly obvious what these do. 
    setFilterMode (int fm)
    getFilterMode ()
	  The filter mode is from 0 to 7, and for the known modes equals the
      various PVR_FILTER_* constants.


To Do
-----
Eventually I want the font characters to get drawn as textured sprites
instead of textured triangles.

When enough of OpenGL has been ported to the Dreamcast, I may try a full port of
PLIB.

so you may get a quicker response if (when appropriate) you send mail to the
KallistiOS list (see sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=23791) or the Dreamcast
Development list (see groups.yahoo.com/group/dcdev/).
