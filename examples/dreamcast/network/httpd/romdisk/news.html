<ul>
<li><b>2002-01-23</b> Florian Schulze announces that <i>I hacked a port of
lwIP to Win32 (Visual C++ 6.0). I did this mainly for testing some
stuff, but it may be usefull for others as well. Its not really
nicely done, but it works. It uses the WinPCap library for the
netif. The sys_arch included is currently only single threaded.</i>
The zip-file containing the port can downloaded <a href="http://homepages.fh-giessen.de/~hg10836/crowproductions/dev/lwip-win32-msvc-0.1.zip">here</a>.<br><br>

<li><b>2002-01-09</b> Axon Digital Design BV in The Netherlands is merging
lwIP with their current IP stack for use in the Synapse modular
broadcasting system, deployed at several broadcasters (such as BBC and
CNN) and broadcast events (Formula 1 races). Axon have contributed
<a href="http://www.esrac.ele.tue.nl/~leon/lwip/">their CS8900A
driver</a> and will submit their DHCP client back to the lwIP project
as open-source. More info about Axon can be found at
<a href="http://www.axon.tv">their website</a>.<br><br>

<li><b>2002-01-09</b> UK based Tangent Devices Ltd are incorporating lwIP
in their film and video post-production equipment, which is planned to
be used on the post-production of Lord of the Rings parts 2 and 3
among other films. More information about Tangent Devices Ltd can be
found at <a href="http://www.tangentdevices.co.uk/">their
website</a>.<br><br>

<li><b>2002-01-08</b> Florian Schulze <a
href="maillist/msg00353.html">announced</a> yesterday that his port of
lwIP to the MS-DOS/DJGPP platform works and can be downloaded from <a
href="http://homepages.fh-giessen.de/~hg10836/dev/djgpp/lwipdjgpptest-0.1.zip">http://homepages.fh-giessen.de/~hg10836/dev/djgpp/lwipdjgpptest-0.1.zip</a>.<br><br>

<li><b>2002-01-08</b> Jose Vasconcellos announced yesterday that the
current CVS version of lwIP and the upcoming 0.5.1 version will be
able to run as a user process under Linux.<br><br>

<li><b>2002-01-04</b> Leon Woestenbergs CS8900a device driver has been
updated to support statistics gathering. It can be found at <a
href="http://www.esrac.ele.tue.nl/~leon/lwip/">http://www.esrac.ele.tue.nl/~leon/lwip/</a><br><br> 

<li><b>2001-12-19</b> Leon Woestenberg 
announced yesterday that his CS8900a device driver for lwIP is
released and avaliable for download at <a
href="http://www.esrac.ele.tue.nl/~leon/lwip/">
http://www.esrac.ele.tue.nl/~leon/lwip/</a>.<br><br>

<li><b>2001-12-12</b> <a href="download.html">Version 0.5.0</a>
released.<br><br> 

<li><b>2001-11-07</b> Joe MacDonald has put an HTML version of the lwIP
source code <a href="http://www.deserted.net/lwIP/">online</a>.<br><br>

<li><b>2001-11-07</b> <a href="download.html">Version 0.4.2</a>
released.<br><br> 

<li><b>2001-10-25</b> The mailling list archives are now <a
href="maillist/">online</a>.<br><br>

<li><b>2001-10-10</b> Robert Pleh is porting lwIP to the RTEMS platform
running the 68360 CPU. First tests are running OK (ping and web
server).<br><br>

<li><b>2001-10-09</b> Jason Morgan announced that he has ported lwIP to
the Infineon C166 (ST10) platform with a SMsC LAN91C96 (or LAN91C94)
Ethernet module. The Keil compiler was used.<br><br>

<li><b>2001-10-09</b> Hongsong Li just announced that lwIP has been
successfully ported to the 8051, based on uC/OS 1.09. Both uC/OS and
lwIP are compiled using the Keil C51 6.14 C compiler. Since the
resulting code size is rather large (60k for lwIP + uC/OS), it is
probably more suited for a demo rather than for an actual product.<br><br>

<li><b>2001-10-08</b> The <a href="mailinglist.html">lwIP mailinglist</a>
is started.<br><br>

<li><b>2001-10-08</b> <a href="download.html">Version 0.4.1</a>
released. This release is a bugfix release and fixes a lot of bugs
from previous releases. <br><br>  

<li><b>2001-10-02</b> A lot of bugs in verion 0.4 have been corrected and
version 0.4.1 will be released in the nearest week.<br><br>

<li><b>2001-06-21</b> lwIP version 0.4 released. This release contains a
new memory subsystem; instead of allocating memory from a shared heap,
objects that are frequently allocated and deallocated are now kept in
memory pools. The memory and buffer subsystems now have support for
4- and 2-byte aligned memory. lwIP 0.4 has also been tested and run
under the RTXC real-time kernel. <a
href="http://lwip-demo.sics.se/">lwip-demo.sics.se</a> is running lwIP
0.4.<br><br>

<li><b>2001-06-20</b> lwIP is now online! The <a
href="http://bart.sm.luth.se/eis2001/">EIS2001 student project</a> at
<a href="http://www.luth.se/">Lule&aring University</a> have donated
some hardware on which lwIP is running a web server. It is accessible
through the URL <a
href="http://lwip-demo.sics.se/">http://lwip-demo.sics.se</a>.<br><br> 

<li><b>2001-06-12</b> The <a
href="http://bart.sm.luth.se/eis2001/">EIS2001 student project</a>
built a board with a <a
href="http://www.mitsubishichips.com/products/mcu/products/m16c/index.html">
Mitsubishi M16</a> CPU with 10k on-chip RAM and a single-chip <a
href="http://www.crystal.com/design/products/overview/index.cfm?DivisionID=4&SubdivisionID=19&ProductID=46">CS8900A
Ethernet controller</a>. lwIP has been successfully ported to this
platform.<br><br>

<li><b>2001-04-25</b> lwIP was successfully demonstrated on the <a
href="http://www.sics.se/openhouse2001/">SICS Open House 2001</a>. We
equipped pulse sensors with a M16 microprocessor and a <a
href="http://www.bluetooth.com/">Bluetooth</a> chip and distributed
pulse sensor data using TCP/IP.<br><br>

<li><b>2001-03-01</b> <a href="download.html">Version 0.3.1</a>
released. This is mainly a bugfix release which fixes a few bugs in
the TCP congestion control, window updates and retransmissions.<br><br>

<li><b>2001-02-27</b> <a href="download.html">Version 0.3</a>
released. This release includes a new and improved directory
structure, better error handling, better stability when run with very
tight memory constraints, many TCP bug fixes, and more comments have
been added to the code. See the <a href="changelog.html">change
log</a> for details.<br><br>

<li><b>2001-02-20</b> Updated documentation: a report describing the design
and implementation of lwIP as well as some brief instructions for
running lwIP under FreeBSD or Linux.<br><br>

<li><b>2001-01-29</b> Initial release (version 0.2).<br><br>
