The subdirectories here are various example programs that each demonstrated
one or two aspects of libdream. Now they have been ported to demonstrate
similar features of KOS 1.1.x. These will also serve as a regression test for
future KOS versions. Only the most important piece of functionality
demonstrated is listed to the side.

hello		-- Serial output, partial initialization
cdfs		-- Reading from a CD-Rom, quiet console output
320x240		-- 320x240x565 mode, full init plus de-init of TA
640x480		-- 640x480x565 mode, quiet console output
800x608		-- 800x608x565 experimental mode; partial init;
		   please see notes in C file
rgb888		-- 640x480x888 mode
ta		-- Tile accelerator; full init, sans threads and romdisk
keyboard	-- Keyboard support, BIOS font; lowlevel only init
mouse		-- Mouse support, BIOS font; lowlevel only init
lcd		-- Timer-based sleep, LCD write; lowlevel only init
vmu		-- VMU read, BIOS font; lowlevel only init
spu		-- Low level SPU access; romdisk usage; romdisk mmap()

If you compiled KOS from the source tree root, then all of this should already
be built for you. If you downloaded binaries, then you will find the pre-built
ELF files in these directories. Note that these are full standalone DC
programs, and must be run as such (not as userland binaries).
