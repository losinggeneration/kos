/* Tunnel Demo by David Bucciarelli. Ported to DC by Paul Boese */

This is a cleaned up port of the Mesa Tunnel Demo by David Bucciarelli. It
was ported to test the GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP code in KGL.  Shortly later 
experimentation with PVR Table fog began.

The ported demo has most of the functionality of the original including
joystick support. 

Feel free to do anything with this code you see fit including depositing it
in /dev/null =D  

It has served its purpose and now I place it here for you to play with.
