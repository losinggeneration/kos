	* genromfs.c: add support for `-a' and `-A'.

	* genromfs.8: document it.

	* Version 0.2.

	* genromfs.8: the manual page has been initially written by
 	Cristoph Lameter, now I reworked it to be less repetitive with
 	respect to the comments in the source :)

	* genromfs.c: just helpful help, and process `-h' too.

	* Makefile: add an install target.
