#!/usr/bin/env python

# This script implements the client side of the Subversion repository dump
# "push" system, the server side of which is implemented in svnpush.py.
#
# Copyright (C)2003 Dan Potter
#

# Usage:
# svnpull.py <repo path> <svnpush URL>
#
# A Subversion repository should exist at <repo path> and not be in use by
# any other client at the time (e.g., stop your Apache instance if you are
# using one, most people won't; make sure other users aren't using it, etc). 
# The <svnpush URL> should be the URL where updates are being posted on
# the web. This should contain one or more xxx_full.dump.bz2 files and zero
# or more xxx_incr.dump.bz2 files. It can be hand-maintained, but will
# generally be maintined by the svnpush.py script.
#
# When the script is run, it will go out to the URL and check the available
# revisions there. This will be compared against the revisions present in the
# local repository. If there are newer revisions present on the site, they
# will be downloaded and applied locally.
#
# Note that this goes only by version numbers -- you are required by this
# currently to not check in anything to your repository locally! If you do
# then strange things may start to happen. Perhaps this can be fixed later.
