gcc-3.4.6-diff:
- Defines SUPPORT_WEAK 0 in config/sh/kos.h so that pthreads will not create
  weak symbols (GNU ld does not extract weak symbols from archives).
- Do not build m2/m2e/m4-single/m4 by default.  Should be unnecessary once
  we have a sh-kos-elf target.
- Adds config/sh/kos.h to config.gcc.  Note: this is under sh-elf-unknown.
  Once we have a sh-kos-elf target, that should be corrected.
- Add sh4/atomicity.h stub, not currently used.  Requires addition of spinlock
  or interrupt disable/enable code.  Currently we use the generic atomicity
  functions, which use pthreads (slow).
- Correct bug (?) in config/generic/atomicity.h (_GLIBCXX_ macros undefined).
- Add sh-unknown-elf defines to libstdc++/crossconfig.m4 -- this was done by
  default (accident?) prior to 3.4.

Generic newlib fixups (applied directly after newlib is installed):
	cp $(kos_base)/include/pthread.h $(newlib_inc)                       # KOS pthread.h is modified
	cp $(kos_base)/include/sys/_pthread.h $(newlib_inc)/sys              # to define _POSIX_THREADS
	cp $(kos_base)/include/sys/sched.h $(newlib_inc)/sys                 # pthreads to kthreads mapping
	ln -nsf $(kos_base)/include/kos $(newlib_inc)                        # so KOS includes are available as kos/file.h
	ln -nsf $(kos_base)/kernel/arch/dreamcast/include/arch $(newlib_inc) # kos/thread.h requires arch/arch.h
	ln -nsf $(kos_base)/kernel/arch/dreamcast/include/dc   $(newlib_inc) # arch/arch.h requires dc/video.h
